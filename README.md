Project with "The Odin Project"

By working on this project I learned basics of HTML and CSS, how they work together and what are their differences. I learned about the difference between the Flexbox and Grid and how we can be combined, I learned how to use different elements and functions... Coming from a 0 knowledge, I found myself trapped in this interest in knowing more and better.
